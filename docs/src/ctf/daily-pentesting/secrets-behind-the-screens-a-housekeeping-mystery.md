# Secrets Behind the Screens: A Housekeeping Mystery

## Scenario

You’ve been contracted as an external consultant to assess the digital infrastructure of Clean & Tidy Services, a
premium housekeeping and cleaning company. While the website presents a sleek, professional interface, your mission is
to dig deeper into the system and uncover potential misconfigurations or hidden information.

## ✅ Questions

### 1. How many paths are not allowed to be indexed by search engines?

Websites often use a `robots.txt` file to instruct search engines on which pages or directories should not be indexed.
This file, typically located at `http://<website>/robots.txt`, can sometimes reveal sensitive paths.

We navigate to `http://132.145.13.96:9994/robots.txt` and find the following content:

```plaintext
User-agent: *
Disallow: /private/
Disallow: /hidden-files/
Disallow: /admin/
```

This tells search engines **not** to index the following three directories:

1. `/private/`
2. `/hidden-files/`
3. `/admin/`

Thus, the answer to this question is **3 paths**.

> **Answer:** 3

### 2. Which path gives access to the admin panel?

Since the `robots.txt` file lists three directories, we attempt to access each one directly in a browser:

- **`/private/`** → Returns an *Internal Server Error (500)*.
- **`/hidden-files/`** → Also returns an *Internal Server Error (500)*.
- **`/admin/`** → Successfully loads an **Admin Login Page**.

![Admin Panel](/ctf/daily-pentesting/secrets-behind-the-screens-a-housekeeping-mystery/admin-panel.png)

From this, we confirm that the **admin panel is accessible at `/admin/`**.

> **Answer:** `/admin/`

### 3. What are the credentials to access the admin panel?

Once at the admin login page, we try common default credentials:

- `admin:admin` ❌
- `admin:123456` ❌
- `admin:password` ✅ *Success!*

Using `admin:password`, we successfully log into the panel.

> **Answer:** `admin:password`

### 4. What is the flag?

After logging in, we are presented with an **administrative dashboard**. Scanning through the panel, we find a message
displaying the flag.

The flag is now successfully retrieved.
